# HARDSTYLEIFIER

Takes your music. Adds hardstyle kicks. That's it.

A vibe-coded mess.

## What it does

Upload a song. It analyzes if it bangs or not. If it doesn't bang enough, it adds hardstyle kicks on every beat. Sidechains the original track so the kicks punch through.

Browser-only processing with essentia.js for beat detection.

Pixoo64 visual integration because why not.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Upload. Analyze. Generate if needed. Download.
